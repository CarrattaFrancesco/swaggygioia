Phase 1: Texture Optimization (Biggest Impact - ~60% faster)
Implement texture preloading - Load all textures in parallel before applying them
Add loading manager - Track overall progress across all assets
Lazy load non-critical textures - Load visible textures first, bloom effects later
Cache texture loading promises - Avoid duplicate loads
Phase 2: Model Loading Optimization (~20% faster)
Defer post-processing setup - Create bloom after model is visible
Single model traversal - Apply all operations in one pass instead of multiple
Optimize material operations - Reduce cloning, reuse materials where possible
Phase 3: Rendering Optimization (~10% faster)
Show model immediately - Display basic materials first, enhance progressively
Defer shadow calculations - Enable shadows after initial render
Lazy initialize bloom - Only create bloom objects when needed
Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements (~10% perceived faster)
Better progress feedback - Show texture loading count
Fade in progressively - Start showing scene at 80% loaded
Optimistic loading text - Update status earlier
